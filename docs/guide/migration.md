# Migration guide

Every breaking release has its own section below, newest first. If you are crossing several
releases at once, work from the bottom of the page upwards.

<!-- New releases go directly below this comment, above the previous one, as `## Upgrading to vX.Y.Z (from vA.B.x)`. -->

## Upgrading to v0.6.0 (from v0.5.7)

Nothing about a response body changes unless you opt in. There is no checklist for this release -
see [Error codes](./error-codes) for what changed and how to opt into it.

`NotFoundError` moves from `fastapi_viewsets.response_classes` to `fastapi_viewsets.exceptions`:

```python
# before
from fastapi_viewsets.response_classes import NotFoundError

# after
from fastapi_viewsets.exceptions import NotFoundError
```
